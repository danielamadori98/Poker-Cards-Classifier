# Card Classification Project Report

## Introduction
This project focuses on the classification of cards using a deep learning model developed with PyTorch. The objective is to accurately classify different types of cards, which could be useful for digital card games, educational purposes, or automating sorting processes. The project utilizes PyTorch for model development, along with other libraries such as sklearn for evaluation metrics.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset comprises images of various cards, divided into multiple classes representing different card types. Data augmentation techniques like rotations and color adjustments were applied to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness. The images were normalized to standardize input data for the model, and the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture chosen for this project is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), optimized for image classification tasks. It includes several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. Activation functions and regularization techniques were carefully selected to improve training and reduce overfitting.

## Training
Training involved tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate and batch size, and the model was optimized using the Adam optimizer. The loss function used to guide the training process was cross-entropy loss, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix was generated to analyze the model's performance across different classes and identify any patterns in misclassifications.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a CNN model capable of classifying cards with high accuracy. It provided valuable insights into model development and data preprocessing for image classification tasks.
